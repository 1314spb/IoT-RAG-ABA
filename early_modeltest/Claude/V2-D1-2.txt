- Domain: Academic and Learning

- Task: Mathematical Problem Solving

- Sub task: Addition with Regrouping

- Description: The client will practice solving addition problems that require regrouping (carrying) to improve mathematical skills and understanding of place value.

- Materials:
  - Worksheet with addition problems requiring regrouping
  - Pencil
  - Base-10 blocks or similar manipulatives
  - Number line
  - Whiteboard and marker

- Procedure:
  1. Present the client with an addition problem requiring regrouping.
  2. Provide base-10 blocks to represent the numbers in the problem.
  3. Guide the client through the process of regrouping using the blocks.
  4. Have the client write out the problem and solution on the worksheet.
  5. Repeat with multiple problems, gradually reducing physical prompts.
  6. Introduce the number line as an alternative method for visualizing regrouping.
  7. Practice problems on the whiteboard for variety and easy correction.

- Data Collection:
  - Record number of correctly solved problems out of total attempts
  - Track time taken to complete each problem
  - Note specific steps where errors occur

- Variations:
  - Use different manipulatives (e.g., counters, place value cards)
  - Incorporate word problems requiring addition with regrouping
  - Practice mental math strategies for simple regrouping problems

- Reinforcement:
  - Provide immediate verbal praise for correct answers and proper technique
  - Use a sticker chart, awarding stickers for completed sets of problems
  - Allow short breaks with a preferred activity after completing a specified number of problems

- Skills Developed:
  - Mathematical computation
  - Understanding of place value
  - Problem-solving strategies
  - Fine motor skills (when using manipulatives)
  - Task persistence
