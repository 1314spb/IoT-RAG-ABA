Task: Teaching Requesting with Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS)

Sub-task:

Introduce PECS cards.
Teach exchanging cards for desired items.
Description: This task focuses on helping individuals improve their communication by teaching them to request items using the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). It involves introducing a set of PECS cards representing common needs and teaching the individual to exchange these cards for desired items.

Materials:

PECS cards (pictures of common items like food, toys, etc.).
Reinforcement items (e.g., snacks, favorite toys).
A communication book for organizing PECS cards.
Procedure:

Begin by showing the individual a preferred item.
Present the corresponding PECS card to the individual.
Guide the individual to pick up the PECS card and hand it to the communication partner.
Once the card is exchanged, immediately give the individual the desired item.
Repeat this process with various items until the individual begins to initiate card exchanges independently.
Data Collection:

Track the number of successful independent exchanges per session.
Record any prompting levels required for each exchange (e.g., full physical, partial physical, verbal).
Measure the time it takes for the individual to exchange the card after being presented with the desired item.
Variations:

Increase the complexity by using more abstract images or multi-step requests (e.g., "I want + item").
Introduce different communication partners in various settings (e.g., home, school) to promote generalization.
Fade prompts gradually to encourage independent communication.
Reinforcement:

Use highly preferred items as immediate reinforcement for successful exchanges.
Provide social praise (e.g., "Good job!" or "Nice asking!") following exchanges.
Rotate reinforcement items to maintain motivation and engagement.
Skills Developed:

Requesting preferred items using alternative communication.
Independent initiation of communication.
Understanding cause-and-effect in communication exchanges.
Generalization of communication skills across different environments.
