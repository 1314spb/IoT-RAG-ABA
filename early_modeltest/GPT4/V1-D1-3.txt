Domain: Academic and Learning
Task: Improving Reading Comprehension
Sub task: Answering WH Questions (Who, What, When, Where, Why)
Description: This task focuses on improving the learner’s ability to comprehend reading material by answering questions about the text. The learner will read or listen to a short passage and then answer WH questions.
Materials: Short reading passages, worksheets with WH questions, pencil or electronic device for writing answers.
Procedure:
Present the learner with a short passage (adjust length based on the learner’s reading level).
After the learner reads or listens to the passage, present them with WH questions (e.g., "Who is the main character?" "Where did the story take place?").
Use prompting as necessary to guide the learner to answer the questions correctly. Fade prompts over time.
Provide immediate feedback on their answers.
Data Collection: Track the number of WH questions answered correctly in each session. Record whether prompts were used and the level of prompting required.
Variations:
Use different types of passages (fiction, non-fiction).
Adjust the complexity of the questions.
Transition from reading the passages aloud to having the learner read independently.
Reinforcement: Provide positive reinforcement for correct answers (e.g., praise, tokens, or preferred activities). Reinforce effort and engagement even if answers are incorrect.
Skills Developed: Reading comprehension, answering questions, critical thinking, focus, and listening skills.
