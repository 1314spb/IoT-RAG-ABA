Domain: Sensory Motor Skill
Task: Improve fine motor skills through object manipulation.
Sub task: Grasping and releasing small objects.
Description: This task focuses on enhancing the childâ€™s ability to grasp, hold, and release small objects to improve fine motor skills and coordination.
Materials: Small objects such as blocks, beads, or buttons, a small basket or container, and a timer.
Procedure:
Present the child with a variety of small objects and a container.
Instruct the child to pick up the objects one by one and place them in the container.
Use prompts if necessary (e.g., hand-over-hand assistance, verbal prompts).
Gradually reduce prompts as the child becomes more proficient.
After all objects are placed in the container, have the child remove them one by one and return them to their original location.
Data Collection: Record the number of successful grasps and releases within a 5-minute period, and note the level of prompting needed (full, partial, or independent).
Variations:
Use objects of different sizes and textures to increase difficulty.
Introduce tweezers or tongs to further refine motor skills.
Set a time limit to encourage faster, yet accurate performance.
Reinforcement: Offer praise, high-fives, or access to a preferred item or activity after a set number of successful attempts.
Skills Developed:
Fine motor coordination
Hand-eye coordination
Precision and dexterity
