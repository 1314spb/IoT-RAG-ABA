Domain: Communication
Task: Developing Functional Communication Skills
Sub task: Teaching Alternative Communication Methods
Description: The task focuses on helping non-verbal or minimally verbal children learn to communicate their needs and wants using alternative methods. This is essential for improving the child's ability to express themselves and reducing frustration-based behaviors.
Materials:
Picture cards or symbols (PECS system)
Communication board
Tablet or speech-generating device (if applicable)
Reinforcement items (e.g., preferred snacks, toys)
Procedure:
Begin by introducing simple picture cards representing common needs like food, drink, bathroom, and toys.
Teach the child to select the appropriate card when they need an item. For example, when they are hungry, prompt them to give you the "food" card.
Provide the desired item immediately after they choose the correct card.
Gradually increase the complexity of requests by introducing more picture cards and expanding the communication board.
If using a speech-generating device, model how to press the corresponding button to request the desired item.
Provide verbal prompts and fading as the child becomes more independent in using the communication tools.
Data Collection: Track the frequency of successful communication exchanges (e.g., the number of times the child correctly uses a picture card or device to request something). Monitor progress weekly and adjust prompts as needed.
Variations:
Use sign language instead of picture cards if appropriate.
Expand to more abstract concepts like feelings (e.g., "happy," "sad") once basic needs are mastered.
Use different settings (home, school) to practice generalization of skills.
Reinforcement: Provide immediate positive reinforcement (e.g., praise, favorite toys, or snacks) whenever the child successfully uses their communication system. Use a token system for consistent success.
Skills Developed:
Improved communication skills
Enhanced ability to express needs and wants
Reduced frustration and problem behaviors
Increased social interaction skills through more effective communication
