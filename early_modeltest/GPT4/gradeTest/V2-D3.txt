Domain: Communication
Task: P.E.C.S.: Phase 4 - Sentences - In PECS book
Sub task: Constructing sentences using "I want" phrase with PECS cards
Description: The student will learn to construct simple sentences using the "I want" phrase in the PECS book to request desired items or activities. This phase aims to expand the studentâ€™s ability to use phrases rather than individual symbols.
Materials: PECS book, "I want" sentence strip, variety of PECS cards representing desired items or activities, reinforcers
Procedure: Present the PECS book with the "I want" sentence strip attached. Prompt the student to place the "I want" card followed by the desired item card onto the sentence strip to make a request. Provide support as needed, and gradually fade prompts until the student can independently construct a request.
Data Collection: Record the number of successful sentence constructions, level of prompting required (e.g., physical, gestural, verbal), and types of requests made.
Variations: Practice with different items to generalize sentence construction across various settings and categories (e.g., food, toys, activities). Incorporate other sentence starters, such as "I see" or "I like," to further expand communication skills.
Reinforcement: Provide the requested item immediately after the correct use of the "I want" sentence strip. Offer verbal praise or another form of reinforcement for attempts to use the sentence strip independently.
Skills Developed: Expanded communication using phrases, sentence construction, requesting, independence in communication, and generalization of language skills across different settings and contexts.
