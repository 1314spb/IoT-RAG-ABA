Domain: Sensory Motor Skill
Task: Fine motor: Dexterity
Sub task: Picking up small objects using fingers
Description: The student will practice using finger dexterity to pick up and manipulate small objects, such as beads or buttons, to improve fine motor skills. The activity aims to strengthen finger muscles and enhance coordination.
Materials: Small objects (e.g., beads, buttons, pom-poms), container for placing picked-up items, tweezers (optional for more advanced practice)
Procedure: Place the small objects on a flat surface. Prompt the student to pick up each object using their thumb and index finger and place it into the container. Provide assistance or modeling if needed. Gradually reduce the level of support as the studentâ€™s dexterity improves.
Data Collection: Record the number of items successfully picked up and placed in the container, level of prompting required (e.g., physical, gestural, verbal), and any improvements in dexterity over time.
Variations: Introduce different types and sizes of objects to vary difficulty. Use tweezers for an added challenge to further refine motor skills.
Reinforcement: Provide verbal praise or a small reward (e.g., sticker, token) for completing the task. Reinforce effort and successful attempts to maintain motivation.
Skills Developed: Finger dexterity, hand-eye coordination, fine motor strength, precision in hand movements, and increased independence in tasks requiring fine motor skills.
