Domain: Academic and Learning
Task: Category: Identify category - Expressive
Sub task: Identifying and naming categories of common classroom objects
Description: The student will identify and name categories of common classroom items, such as "writing tools," "books," or "art supplies." The task aims to develop expressive language skills by improving the ability to describe and categorize items.
Materials: Collection of classroom objects or pictures of classroom items (e.g., pencil, ruler, crayon, notebook, scissors)
Procedure: Present the student with 5-10 classroom items or pictures of items. Ask the student to group the items by category and verbally label the categories. Provide prompting and reinforcement as needed.
Data Collection: Record the number of items categorized correctly and the level of prompting required (e.g., independent, verbal, or physical).
Variations: Use different types of objects, such as household or outdoor items, to generalize the skill across environments. Use visual supports like category labels or color-coded bins to assist with categorization.
Reinforcement: Provide praise or a small reward (e.g., sticker) after successful categorization. Reinforce any verbal attempts at naming categories, even if incorrect, to encourage expressive language.
Skills Developed: Expressive language, categorization, vocabulary development, critical thinking, and generalization of learned skills across different contexts.
