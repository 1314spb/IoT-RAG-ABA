Domain: Independent and Self-help
Task: Play: Imaginary Play
Sub task: Engaging in role-playing scenarios
Description: The student will engage in imaginary play by role-playing different scenarios, such as being a chef, a doctor, or a teacher. This activity helps develop independence, creativity, and problem-solving skills while fostering social-emotional understanding.
Materials: Dress-up clothes, toy props (e.g., toy stethoscope, cooking utensils, stuffed animals), role-play area
Procedure: Introduce a role-play scenario to the student, such as pretending to be a chef cooking a meal. Provide prompts or model behavior initially, then encourage the student to take the lead in the role-play. Allow the student to interact with props and create their own imaginary scenarios. Gradually fade out support as the student becomes more comfortable engaging in play independently.
Data Collection: Record the duration of independent play, types of roles played, and level of prompting required (e.g., physical, gestural, verbal). Note any creative actions or social interactions during play.
Variations: Introduce different role-play scenarios, such as running a store, visiting a doctor, or being a teacher. Encourage interaction with peers or siblings to further develop social skills.
Reinforcement: Provide verbal praise or small rewards (e.g., stickers, tokens) for engaging in imaginary play. Reinforce creativity and independence in role-playing activities.
Skills Developed: Independent play, creativity, role-playing, problem-solving, social interaction, imaginative thinking, and language development through dialogue in play scenarios.
