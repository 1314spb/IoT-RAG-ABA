Domain: Sensory Motor Skill
Task: Improving Fine Motor Skills
Sub task: Threading Beads
Description: The child will practice threading beads onto a string to enhance their fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and focus.
Materials: Large beads of various colors, a thick string, and a stable surface.
Procedure:
Present the materials to the child.
Demonstrate threading one bead onto the string.
Encourage the child to thread the beads independently, providing prompts if needed.
Allow the child to choose different colored beads to enhance engagement.
Repeat the activity several times, gradually increasing the difficulty by using smaller beads or providing less support.
Data Collection: Record the number of beads successfully threaded within a set time (e.g., 10 minutes) and note any prompts provided.
Variations:
Use beads of different sizes and shapes.
Incorporate patterns (e.g., alternating colors) to introduce a cognitive component.
Reinforcement: Provide verbal praise and small tangible rewards (e.g., stickers) after successful attempts to motivate the child.
Skills Developed: Fine motor control, hand-eye coordination, concentration, and following instructions.
