- Task: Teaching Sentence Completion
- Sub task: Completing sentences with correct grammatical structure and context
- Description: This task targets the development of sentence completion skills, which is an essential aspect of effective communication. The therapist will provide the individual with a sentence starter and encourage them to complete it with a grammatically correct sentence.
- Materials: 
  - Sentence completion cards or a sentence completion worksheet
  - Pencil or pen
  - Eraser
- Procedure: 
  1. Present the individual with a sentence starter (e.g., "The cat is ___________").
  2. Encourage the individual to complete the sentence with a grammatically correct sentence (e.g., "The cat is sleeping").
  3. If the individual's response is incorrect, gently prompt them to revise the sentence.
  4. Provide reinforcement for correct sentence completion (e.g., praise, a sticker, or a small reward).
  5. Gradually increase the difficulty of the sentence starters (e.g., using more complex grammar or vocabulary).
- Data Collection: 
  - Record the number of correct sentence completions.
  - Record the number of incorrect sentence completions.
  - Note any challenges or difficulties the individual experiences during the task.
- Variations: 
  - Use sentence starters with different grammatical structures (e.g., present tense, past tense, future tense).
  - Use sentence starters with different vocabulary (e.g., abstract concepts, concrete objects).
  - Increase the length of the sentence starters (e.g., using multiple clauses).
  - Incorporate visual aids or props to support the task.
- Reinforcement: 
  - Verbal praise (e.g., "Great job completing the sentence correctly!")
  - Nonverbal praise (e.g., a thumbs-up or a smile)
  - Tangible rewards (e.g., stickers, small toys, or treats)
  - Social reinforcement (e.g., "I like the way you structured that sentence!")
