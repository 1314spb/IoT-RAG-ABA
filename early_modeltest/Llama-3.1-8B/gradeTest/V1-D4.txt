- Domain: Sensory Motor Skill
- Task: Fine motor: Dexterity
- Subtask: Pick up small beads/Thumb and middle finger (beads 1 cm diameter)
- Description: The learner will practice picking up small beads using their thumb and middle finger, developing their fine motor skills and hand dexterity.
- Materials: 
  - 100 small beads with 1 cm diameter
  - A tray or plate to hold the beads
  - A chair or table for the learner to sit at
  - A timer (optional)
- Procedure: 
  1. Begin by placing a small number of beads on the tray or plate in front of the learner.
  2. Demonstrate how to pick up a bead using the thumb and middle finger.
  3. Have the learner practice picking up a bead and placing it in a container (e.g., a small cup or jar).
  4. Gradually increase the number of beads on the tray or plate as the learner becomes more proficient.
  5. Set a timer for a short interval (e.g., 30 seconds) and have the learner pick up as many beads as possible during that time.
  6. After the timer goes off, review the number of beads the learner picked up and provide feedback.
- Data Collection: 
  - Record the number of beads the learner picks up during each trial.
  - Record the time it takes the learner to pick up a certain number of beads.
- Variations: 
  - Increase the size of the beads to make it more challenging for the learner.
  - Decrease the size of the beads to make it easier for the learner.
  - Use different shapes or textures of beads to add variety.
  - Have the learner pick up beads from a container or a tray with different levels of difficulty (e.g., beads placed on a slope or in a small container).
- Reinforcement: 
  - Praise the learner for their efforts and progress.
  - Use verbal reinforcement (e.g., "Great job!") or non-verbal reinforcement (e.g., a thumbs up).
  - Provide a reward for meeting certain goals or milestones (e.g., picking up a certain number of beads in a row).
- Skills Developed: 
  - Fine motor skills
  - Dexterity
  - Hand-eye coordination
  - Spatial awareness
  - Adaptability
  - Persistence
