**Domain:** Academic and Learning

**Task:** Science Experimentation Skills

**Sub task:** Conducting a simple science experiment

**Description:** This task is designed to teach the client to conduct a simple science experiment, including planning, preparing, and executing the experiment.

**Materials:**

* Science experiment kit or materials (e.g. magnets, batteries, wires, etc.)
* Whiteboard or chalkboard for planning and recording data
* Data sheet for recording observations and results
* Stopwatch or timer for measuring time

**Procedure:**

1. Introduce the client to the science experiment kit or materials and explain the goal of the experiment.
2. Have the client plan and prepare the experiment, including setting up the materials and equipment.
3. Have the client conduct the experiment, taking note of observations and recording data on the data sheet.
4. Have the client analyze the results and draw conclusions based on the data collected.
5. Provide feedback and encouragement to the client as they complete the experiment.

**Data Collection:**

* Collect data on the client's ability to plan and prepare the experiment.
* Collect data on the client's ability to conduct the experiment and record observations and results.
* Collect data on the client's ability to analyze the results and draw conclusions.

**Variations:**

* Use different types of science experiments, such as chemistry or physics, to increase variety.
* Incorporate real-world applications of the science experiment to increase relevance.
* Use technology, such as computer simulations or online resources, to provide additional science experiment opportunities.

**Reinforcement:**

* Praise the client for their efforts and progress.
* Use rewards, such as stickers or small toys, to motivate the client.
* Provide opportunities for the client to apply science skills in real-world situations.

**Skills Developed:**

* Science experimentation skills
* Critical thinking and problem-solving skills
* Data collection and analysis skills
* Ability to apply scientific knowledge in real-world situations
