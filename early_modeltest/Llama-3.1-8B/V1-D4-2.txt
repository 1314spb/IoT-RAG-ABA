- Domain: Sensory Motor Skill
- Task: "Sensory Bin Exploration"
- Sub task: Exploring different textures and objects in a bin using hands and fingers
- Description: This task aims to improve tactile awareness, fine motor skills, and sensory integration by engaging the individual in exploring various textures and objects in a bin.
- Materials: 
  - A large bin or container
  - Different textures and objects (e.g., beads, rice, sand, play dough, small toys)
  - Optional: a scoop, spoon, or other tools for exploration
- Procedure:
  1. Fill the bin with a specific texture or object, and encourage the individual to explore it using their hands and fingers.
  2. Gradually introduce new textures or objects, and observe the individual's response and engagement.
  3. Monitor and record the individual's progress, taking note of their ability to identify and differentiate between different textures and objects.
- Data Collection:
  - Frequency and duration of exploration
  - Accuracy in identifying and differentiating between textures and objects
  - Individual's self-report of their experience (e.g., enjoyment, frustration)
- Variations:
  - Change the size or shape of the bin to adjust the level of difficulty
  - Add or remove textures and objects to increase or decrease sensory stimulation
  - Incorporate auditory or visual stimuli to enhance the sensory experience
- Reinforcement:
  - Verbal praise and encouragement
  - Physical praise (e.g., high-fives, hugs)
  - Tangible rewards (e.g., stickers, small toys)
- Skills Developed:
  - Tactile awareness
  - Fine motor skills
  - Sensory integration
  - Self-regulation and self-motivation
