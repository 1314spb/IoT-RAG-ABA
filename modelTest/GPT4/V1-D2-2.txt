Once the learner identifies the emotion, prompt them to mimic the expression in a mirror if applicable.
Provide immediate feedback and reinforce correct responses.
Data Collection: Track the number of emotions correctly identified by the learner in each session, along with the level of prompting required.

Introduce more subtle or complex emotions (e.g., frustrated, confused).
Practice identifying emotions in real-life scenarios or video clips.
Pair the identification with verbal descriptions of when and why a person might feel this way.
Reinforcement: Offer positive reinforcement for correct identification and effort, such as verbal praise, tokens, or access to a preferred activity.
