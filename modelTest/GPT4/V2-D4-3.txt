Domain: Sensory Motor Skill
Task: Improve Fine Motor Coordination
Sub task: Grasping and Releasing Objects
Description: This task aims to enhance the childâ€™s ability to grasp and release small objects with precision, improving hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills.
Materials: Small blocks, toy rings, a container or basket, and a table.
Procedure:
Place the small blocks or rings on a table.
Instruct the child to pick up a block or ring with their thumb and index finger (pincer grasp) and place it into a container.
Gradually increase the size of the object as the child gains mastery.
Provide physical prompts as needed, and fade these prompts as the child improves.
Data Collection: Record the number of successful grasps and releases in a 5-minute session, noting any assistance required.
Variations:
Use different sized objects to challenge grasping skills.
Introduce objects with different textures or weights to promote tactile awareness.
Reinforcement: Provide verbal praise and a small token (e.g., sticker or favorite item) after each successful attempt or improvement in performance.
Skills Developed: Hand-eye coordination, fine motor precision, task persistence, and object manipulation.
