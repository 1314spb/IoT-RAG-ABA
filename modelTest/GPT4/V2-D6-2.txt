Domain: Behavioral Development
Task: Improving Social Interaction Skills
Sub task: Initiating and Maintaining Conversations
Description: This task focuses on teaching the client to initiate and maintain conversations with peers and adults. The goal is to increase appropriate social interactions by improving communication and social initiation behaviors.
Materials: Visual prompts (e.g., conversation topic cards), social storybooks, tokens for reinforcement, and a peer or therapist for role-play interactions.
Procedure:
Introduce conversation topic cards to the client and explain how to use them to start a conversation.
Use modeling to demonstrate how to initiate a conversation (e.g., by asking a peer about their day).
Use role-play exercises where the client practices initiating conversations with peers or adults.
Gradually fade prompts and encourage the client to initiate conversations independently.
Provide reinforcement (e.g., tokens or verbal praise) for successful initiation and maintenance of conversations.
Data Collection: Record the frequency of initiated conversations and how long the client maintains the conversation (e.g., number of back-and-forth exchanges).
Variations:
Practice with different peers or adults.
Use different conversation starters based on the clientâ€™s interests.
Implement in various settings (e.g., home, school, playground).
Reinforcement: Provide tokens, verbal praise, or preferred activities after successful conversation initiation and maintenance.
Skills Developed: Social initiation, communication, conversational turn-taking, and peer interaction.
