Domain: Academic and Learning
Task: Improving Reading Comprehension
Sub task: Answering WH Questions (Who, What, Where, When, Why)
Description: This task focuses on teaching the learner to answer WH questions related to a short passage. The learner will practice identifying key details in the text to answer questions, enhancing reading comprehension and recall skills.
Materials:
Short passages or stories (printed or digital)
Visual aids (e.g., pictures related to the story)
WH question cards (Who, What, Where, When, Why)
Tokens or a reward chart
Procedure:
Introduce the short passage to the learner, either by reading it aloud or having them read it independently.
Present visual aids that correspond with the story for added support.
Ask the learner specific WH questions about the passage. Start with "who" and "what" questions, then gradually introduce "where," "when," and "why" questions.
Provide prompts if necessary, such as visual cues or rereading parts of the passage.
Use tokens or other reinforcement systems to reward correct responses.
Gradually reduce prompts as the learner improves.
Data Collection: Track the number of correct responses for each type of WH question. Collect data on the level of prompting required (e.g., full prompt, partial prompt, independent).
Variations:
Use different types of texts (e.g., fiction, nonfiction) based on the learnerâ€™s interests.
Incorporate peer interactions by having the learner answer questions in a group setting.
Vary the difficulty of the passages as the learner progresses.
Reinforcement: Use positive reinforcement, such as tokens, praise, or access to a preferred activity after completing the task.
Skills Developed:
Reading comprehension
Critical thinking
Language skills
Recall and memory improvement
Ability to answer WH questions independently
