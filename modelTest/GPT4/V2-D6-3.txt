Task: Teaching Functional Communication

Sub task: Using a Communication Book for Requesting Items

Description: This task focuses on helping non-verbal children learn to request their needs using a communication book with visual supports like pictures and icons.

Materials:

Communication book with picture icons (representing common items like food, drink, bathroom).
Reinforcement tokens (stickers, small toys, etc.).
Procedure:

Present the child with a communication book.
Encourage the child to select and point to a picture of an item they want (e.g., food).
Prompt the child if necessary, by guiding their hand or using verbal cues like “Which one do you want?”
Once the child selects a picture, acknowledge it and immediately provide the requested item (e.g., hand them the food).
Repeat the process several times with different items, gradually fading prompts over time.
Data Collection:
Track the number of independent requests made by the child each session. Record whether prompts were needed or if the child made the request spontaneously.

Variations:

Add more pictures/icons for additional requests as the child becomes more proficient.
Use the communication book in different settings (e.g., home, school) to encourage generalization.
Reinforcement:
Offer praise, tokens, or the desired item immediately after the child successfully makes a request, even if prompted.

Skills Developed:

Functional communication.
Decision-making and choice-making.
Improved attention and focus through task engagement.
