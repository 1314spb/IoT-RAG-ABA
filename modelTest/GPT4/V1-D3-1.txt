Domain: Communication
Task: Building Conversation Skills
Sub task: Turn-Taking in Conversations
Description: This task focuses on teaching the learner to participate in conversations by taking turns speaking and listening. The learner will practice engaging in back-and-forth dialogue with a peer or therapist, learning to wait for their turn to speak and respond appropriately.
Materials: Conversation topic cards, visual aids for turn-taking (e.g., a talking stick or timer), social story books about conversations.
Procedure:
Choose a topic of interest and begin a simple conversation with the learner.
Use a visual aid (e.g., talking stick) to show whose turn it is to speak.
Encourage the learner to wait for their turn to speak and to respond when it is their turn.
Provide prompting and guidance if the learner interrupts or has difficulty waiting. Gradually fade prompts.
Reinforce appropriate turn-taking and responses.
Data Collection: Track the number of successful turn-taking exchanges, interruptions, and the level of prompting required.
Variations:
Use different conversation topics based on the learner's interests.
Introduce more peers into the conversation to increase complexity.
Use longer or more complex conversations as the learner becomes more proficient.
Reinforcement: Provide positive reinforcement such as verbal praise, tokens, or a preferred activity for waiting their turn and responding appropriately.
Skills Developed: Conversation skills, listening, patience, turn-taking, and social interaction.
