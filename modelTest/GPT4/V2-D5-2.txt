Task: Teaching Dressing Skills
Sub task: Buttoning a Shirt
Description: This task focuses on helping the child develop independence in dressing, specifically learning how to button a shirt, which enhances self-help and fine motor skills.
Materials: A shirt with large buttons, a chair, and a mirror.
Procedure:
Place the shirt on the childâ€™s lap or on a table.
Demonstrate how to line up the buttons with the buttonholes.
Prompt the child to insert the button into the hole, using physical guidance if needed.
Gradually fade physical prompts as the child becomes more proficient.
Encourage the child to button each button independently.
Data Collection: Record the number of buttons the child successfully buttons within a 5-minute session, noting the level of assistance provided (full prompt, partial prompt, or independent).
Variations:
Use shirts with smaller buttons as the child masters larger ones.
Practice with different types of fasteners, such as zippers or snaps.
Reinforcement: Offer verbal praise and small rewards (e.g., a preferred activity or item) for each successful attempt and improvement.
Skills Developed: Fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, self-care, and independence in dressing.
