**task: Greetings: Responding**
**subtask: say "hi + name" when being greeted, in any situations, any rooms**

**Description:**
The subtask of saying "hi + name" when being greeted in any situation and location is a fundamental skill in Social Emotion that enables individuals to respond appropriately to social interactions, build relationships, and develop a sense of belonging. This subtask is crucial for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or other developmental disabilities who may struggle with social interactions and initiating or responding to greetings.

**Materials:**

* A list of names (e.g., "Hi, John", "Hi, Sarah", etc.)
* A variety of greeting scenarios (e.g., in-person, video call, phone call)
* A timer or stopwatch
* A data collection sheet

**Procedure:**

1. Begin by introducing the subtask to the individual and explaining the importance of responding to greetings.
2. Choose a name from the list and practice saying "hi + name" together with the individual (e.g., "Hi, John").
3. Gradually increase the difficulty by using different names, scenarios (in-person, video call, phone call), and locations (e.g., in the classroom, at home, in a public place).
4. Use the timer to time the individual's response to a greeting, aiming for a response within 5-10 seconds.
5. Repeat the procedure multiple times, varying the scenarios and names.

**Data Collection:**

* Record the individual's response time to a greeting
* Note the accuracy of the response (e.g., did they say the correct name?)
* Track the individual's progress over time

**Variations:**

* Use different tones of voice or inflections when giving the greeting
* Incorporate nonverbal cues (e.g., waving, smiling)
* Use a variety of names and scenarios to generalize the skill

**Reinforcement:**

* Praise the individual for their correct responses
* Use a reward system (e.g., stickers, stars, points) to track progress
* Provide physical rewards (e.g., high-fives, hugs) for successful responses

**Skills Developed:**

* Responding to greetings in various situations and locations
* Using names correctly in social interactions
* Developing a sense of social awareness and belonging
* Improving communication skills
* Enhancing relationships with others
