**domain: Academic and Learning**
**task: Category: Identify category - Expressive**
**subtask: Food, 2-3 items in category given; "Xx, yy, zz are all (_____)"**

**Description:** The goal of this task is to assess the individual's ability to identify and categorize items based on a specific category (food) and their ability to express their understanding through verbal responses.

**Materials:**

* A set of 3-4 pictures or flashcards with different food items (e.g., apple, banana, cake, etc.)
* A whiteboard or paper for writing
* A marker or pen

**Procedure:**

1. Begin by showing the individual the three pictures or flashcards and ask them to identify the category that these items belong to (e.g., "What do these things have in common?").
2. Write the category on the board or paper (e.g., "Food").
3. Ask the individual to give an example of another item that belongs to the same category (e.g., "Can you think of another food?").
4. Repeat steps 1-3 several times to assess the individual's understanding and ability to generalize the category.

**Data Collection:**

* Record the individual's verbal responses to the questions
* Note whether the individual is able to identify the correct category (food) and provide examples of other items that belong to that category
* Record the time it takes for the individual to respond to the questions

**Variations:**

* Use different categories (e.g., animals, toys, etc.) and items to assess the individual's ability to generalize the task
* Use more or fewer items in the category to adjust the difficulty level
* Use different types of stimuli (e.g., real objects, pictures, etc.) to assess the individual's ability to respond to different types of stimuli

**Reinforcement:**

* Provide praise and encouragement for correct responses
* Use tangible reinforcement (e.g., stickers, small toys, etc.) for correct responses
* Gradually phase out reinforcement as the individual becomes more proficient in the task

**Skills Developed:**

* Categorization skills
* Identifying and expressing understanding of categories
* Generalization of categories to different items and stimuli
* Verbal communication skills
* Problem-solving skills
