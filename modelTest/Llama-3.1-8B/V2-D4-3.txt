- Task: Tracing Shapes with a Finger
- Subtask: 
  - Subtask 1: Improving hand-eye coordination and fine motor control
  - Subtask 2: Enhancing finger isolation and independence
- Description: This task is designed to improve hand-eye coordination, fine motor control, and finger isolation in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or other developmental delays. Tracing shapes with a finger involves moving the finger along a shape, which helps develop hand-eye coordination, fine motor control, and finger isolation.
- Materials: 
  - A large piece of paper or a whiteboard
  - A marker or a dry-erase marker
  - A shape template (e.g., a circle, a square, a triangle)
  - A finger tracing guide (e.g., a small stick or a pencil)
- Procedure:
  1. Begin with a simple shape (e.g., a circle).
  2. Demonstrate how to hold the shape template and move the finger along the shape.
  3. Encourage the child to imitate the actions.
  4. Gradually introduce more complex shapes (e.g., a square, a triangle).
  5. Rotate the shape template and the finger tracing guide to maintain interest.
- Data Collection: 
  - Observe the child's ability to move the finger along the shape.
  - Record the frequency and duration of successful tracing.
  - Evaluate the child's ability to isolate and use individual fingers.
- Variations:
  - Use different shapes and sizes of shape templates.
  - Incorporate different textures and materials (e.g., sandpaper, playdough).
  - Modify the shape template to accommodate different grip sizes or abilities.
- Reinforcement: 
  - Praise the child for successful tracing.
  - Offer verbal encouragement and positive reinforcement.
  - Use visual aids, such as stickers or stars, to track progress.
- Skills Developed: 
  - Hand-eye coordination
  - Fine motor control
  - Finger isolation and independence
  - Motor planning
