- Domain: Sensory Motor Skill
- Task: Developing Fine Motor Skills through Playdough Manipulation
- Subtask: 
  - Subtask 1: Improving hand-eye coordination and dexterity
  - Subtask 2: Enhancing finger isolation and independence
- Description: This task is designed to improve fine motor skills in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or other developmental delays. Playdough manipulation involves using hands to shape, mold, and manipulate playdough, which helps develop hand-eye coordination, finger isolation, and dexterity.
- Materials: 
  - Playdough in various textures and colors
  - Playdough tools (e.g., rollers, cutters, molds)
  - A surface for playdough manipulation
- Procedure:
  1. Begin with a small amount of playdough and a simple tool (e.g., a rolling pin).
  2. Demonstrate how to roll, shape, and manipulate the playdough.
  3. Encourage the child to imitate the actions.
  4. Gradually introduce more complex tools and textures.
  5. Rotate the playdough and tools regularly to maintain interest.
- Data Collection: 
  - Observe the child's ability to manipulate the playdough using different tools.
  - Record the frequency and duration of playdough manipulation.
  - Evaluate the child's ability to isolate and use individual fingers.
- Variations:
  - Use different textures and temperatures of playdough (e.g., warm, cool, sticky).
  - Incorporate other materials, such as beads, rice, or sand, for added tactile stimulation.
  - Modify the playdough tools to accommodate different grip sizes or abilities.
- Reinforcement: 
  - Praise the child for successful playdough manipulation.
  - Offer verbal encouragement and positive reinforcement.
  - Use visual aids, such as stickers or stars, to track progress.
- Skills Developed: 
  - Fine motor skills
  - Hand-eye coordination
  - Finger isolation and independence
  - Dexterity
  - Tactile awareness
