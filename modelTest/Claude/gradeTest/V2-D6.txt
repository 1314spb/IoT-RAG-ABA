- Domain: Behavioural Development
- Task: Attention training: Sustaining attention - reading/writing
- Subtask: Increase duration of focused attention during reading and writing activities
- Description: This task aims to improve the client's ability to sustain attention while engaging in reading and writing activities, gradually increasing the duration of focused attention over time.
- Materials:
  * Age-appropriate books or reading materials
  * Writing materials (paper, pencils, or digital devices if applicable)
  * Timer or stopwatch
  * Reinforcement items or tokens
  * Visual schedule or timer display
- Procedure:
  1. Begin with a baseline assessment of the client's current attention span during reading/writing tasks.
  2. Set an initial goal slightly above the baseline (e.g., if baseline is 2 minutes, set initial goal to 2.5 minutes).
  3. Present the reading or writing task to the client.
  4. Use a visual timer to show the duration of the task.
  5. Provide verbal praise and encouragement throughout the task.
  6. If the client completes the set duration, provide immediate reinforcement.
  7. Gradually increase the duration of the task as the client consistently meets goals.
  8. Incorporate short breaks between attention periods to prevent fatigue.
- Data Collection:
  * Record the duration of sustained attention for each session
  * Note any instances of off-task behavior or distractions
  * Track progress over time using a line graph
- Variations:
  * Alternate between reading and writing tasks
  * Use different types of reading materials (e.g., stories, non-fiction, puzzles)
  * Incorporate digital reading or writing tasks if appropriate
- Reinforcement:
  * Use a token economy system, where tokens are earned for completing attention periods
  * Provide immediate verbal praise and small tangible rewards for meeting time goals
  * Allow the client to choose a preferred activity after completing the task
- Skills Developed:
  * Sustained attention
  * Reading comprehension
  * Writing skills
  * Task persistence
