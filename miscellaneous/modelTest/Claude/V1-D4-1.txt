- Task: Texture Sorting
- Sub task: Identifying and grouping objects by texture
- Description: The child will sort various objects into groups based on their textures (smooth, rough, soft, etc.)
- Materials: A variety of small objects with different textures (e.g., cotton balls, sandpaper, smooth stones, fuzzy fabric, plastic blocks)
- Procedure:

  2. Demonstrate how to feel each object and sort into groups based on texture
  3. Guide the child to sort the remaining objects, providing assistance as needed
  4. Gradually reduce assistance as the child becomes more proficient
- Data Collection: Record the number of objects correctly sorted without prompting
- Variations:
  1. Increase the number of texture categories
  2. Use blindfold for purely tactile sorting
  3. Incorporate matching textures to environmental objects
- Reinforcement: Praise for correct sorting, token system for completed sets
- Skills Developed: Tactile discrimination, fine motor skills, categorization, sensory processing
