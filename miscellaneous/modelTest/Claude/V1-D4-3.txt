- Domain: Sensory Motor Skill
- Task: Finger Painting Patterns
- Sub task: Creating shapes and patterns using finger paints
- Description: The child will use finger paints to create specific shapes and patterns on paper, developing fine motor skills and sensory integration
- Materials: Finger paints, large sheets of paper, smocks or old shirts, wet wipes
- Procedure:
  1. Set up the painting area and put smocks on the child
  2. Demonstrate how to dip fingers in paint and create simple shapes (circle, square, line)
  3. Guide the child to imitate the shapes, providing hand-over-hand assistance if needed
  4. Gradually introduce more complex patterns (zigzag, spiral, cross)
  5. Encourage independent creation of shapes and patterns
- Data Collection: Record the number of shapes/patterns correctly reproduced without assistance
- Variations:
  1. Use different textures mixed into the paint (sand, rice)
  2. Create patterns on vertical surfaces
  3. Incorporate two-handed symmetrical patterns
- Reinforcement: Verbal praise, displaying artwork, choice of next color/pattern
- Skills Developed: Fine motor control, hand-eye coordination, sensory processing, creativity, pattern recognition
