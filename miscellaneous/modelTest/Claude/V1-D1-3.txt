- Domain: Academic and Learning
- Task: Basic Algebra
- Sub task: Solving One-Step Equations
- Description: The learner will solve simple one-step algebraic equations involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
- Materials: Equation cards, whiteboard, dry-erase marker, small manipulatives (e.g., counters)
- Procedure:
  1. Present an equation card to the learner.
  2. Ask the learner to read the equation aloud.
  3. Guide the learner to identify the operation needed to solve for x.
  4. Instruct the learner to perform the inverse operation.
  5. Have the learner write the solution on the whiteboard.
  6. Check the answer together by substituting the solution back into the original equation.
- Data Collection: Record number of correctly solved equations out of total attempts
- Variations:
  1. Use larger numbers or decimals
  2. Include negative numbers
  3. Incorporate word problems that translate to one-step equations
- Reinforcement: Point system with rewards, computer game time, or choice of next math activity
- Skills Developed: Algebraic thinking, problem-solving, inverse operations, mathematical reasoning
