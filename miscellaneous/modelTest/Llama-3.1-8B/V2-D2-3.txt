- Domain: Social Emotion
- Task: Recognizing and Expressing Emotions in a Group Setting
- Sub task: Identifying and Labeling Emotions of Others in a Group
- Description: This task aims to teach the client to recognize and express emotions in a group setting, promoting social skills and understanding of others' feelings.
- Materials: 
  - Emotion cards with different facial expressions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, surprised)
  - Group scenario cards or pictures
  - Whiteboard or chart paper
- Procedure:
  1. Begin by introducing the concept of emotions and asking the client to identify how they feel when viewing the emotion cards.
  2. Show the client group scenario cards or pictures and ask them to identify how the characters might be feeling.
  3. Use the whiteboard or chart paper to create a "feeling chart" with different emotions listed (e.g., happy, sad, angry, surprised).
  4. Ask the client to point to the emotion that they think the character is feeling and label it on the chart.
  5. Gradually introduce more complex group scenarios and ask the client to identify and label emotions in a group setting.
  6. Use reinforcement techniques, such as praise and positive reinforcement, to encourage the client to engage in recognizing and expressing emotions in a group setting.
- Data Collection:
  - Observe the client's ability to identify and label emotions in a group setting.
  - Track the client's progress in recognizing and expressing emotions in a group setting.
  - Use rating scales or checklists to assess the client's ability to identify and label emotions in a group setting.
- Variations:
  - For clients with more advanced skills, introduce more complex group scenarios and ask them to identify and label multiple emotions.
  - For clients with more basic skills, use simpler group scenarios and focus on identifying and labeling one emotion.
  - Use different types of materials, such as videos or real-life situations, to provide more diverse and engaging opportunities for recognizing and expressing emotions in a group setting.
- Reinforcement:
  - Praise the client for their efforts and progress in recognizing and expressing emotions in a group setting.
  - Use positive reinforcement, such as stickers or stars, to encourage the client to engage in identifying and labeling emotions.
  - Gradually phase out reinforcement as the client becomes more proficient in recognizing and expressing emotions in a group setting.
- Skills Developed:
  - Identifying and labeling emotions of others in a group
