**Task:** Teaching Adaptive Play with Puzzles

**Sub task:** Encouraging problem-solving skills through puzzle-solving with a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)

**Description:** This task aims to teach a child with ASD to engage in adaptive play with puzzles, promoting problem-solving skills, spatial reasoning, and fine motor skills.

**Materials:**

* A variety of puzzles with different difficulty levels and shapes (e.g., jigsaw puzzles, sliding puzzles, and shape sorters)
* A table or play area with a comfortable working surface
* A timer (optional)
* A data sheet for tracking progress

**Procedure:**

1. Begin by presenting the puzzle to the child and explaining the objective (e.g., "Let's put the puzzle pieces together!").
2. Demonstrate how to solve the puzzle by breaking it down into smaller steps (e.g., identifying the correct shape, finding the matching piece, and fitting it into place).
3. Encourage the child to attempt to solve the puzzle independently, providing guidance and support as needed.
4. If the child becomes frustrated or stuck, use a visual prompt (e.g., a picture or a diagram) to help them understand the solution.
5. Gradually increase the difficulty level of the puzzles as the child becomes more confident and proficient.

**Data Collection:**

* Track the number of puzzles completed successfully
* Record the time taken to complete each puzzle
* Note any challenges or difficulties encountered during the task
* Monitor the child's fine motor skills, problem-solving skills, and spatial reasoning

**Variations:**

* Use different types of puzzles, such as 3D puzzles or puzzles with moving parts
* Incorporate technology, such as puzzle apps or digital puzzles, to increase engagement and accessibility
* Adapt the task to address specific learning goals, such as teaching color recognition or shape identification

**Reinforcement:**

* Praise the child for their efforts and progress
* Use verbal encouragement and positive reinforcement (e.g., "You're doing a great job!")
* Offer tangible rewards, such as stickers or small toys, for successful puzzle completion
* Consider providing a break or a preferred activity after completing a challenging puzzle

**Skills Developed:**

* Adaptive play skills
* Problem-solving skills
* Fine motor skills
* Spatial reasoning
* Color recognition
* Shape identification
* Critical thinking
* Self-confidence
