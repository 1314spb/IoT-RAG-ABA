**Domain: Sensory Motor Skill**

**Task: Fine motor: Dexterity**

**Subtask: Pick up small beads/Thumb and middle finger (beads 1 cm diameter)**

**Description:** 
The client will practice picking up small beads using their thumb and middle finger, promoting fine motor dexterity and hand-eye coordination.

**Materials:**

* Small beads (1 cm in diameter)
* Tray or plate for bead placement
* Optional: timer, data sheet, and visual supports

**Procedure:**

1. Begin by placing a few beads on a tray or plate in front of the client.
2. Encourage the client to pick up a bead using their thumb and middle finger.
3. Gradually increase the number of beads on the tray as the client becomes more proficient.
4. Monitor the client's ability to pick up the beads and adjust the difficulty level as needed.
5. Use verbal praise and rewards to reinforce successful attempts.

**Data Collection:**

* Record the number of beads picked up correctly within a set time frame (e.g., 30 seconds).
* Track the client's accuracy rate (e.g., percentage of beads picked up correctly).
* Use data to adjust the difficulty level and reinforce successful attempts.

**Variations:**

* Use different sizes or shapes of beads to increase or decrease difficulty.
* Gradually increase the number of beads on the tray.
* Add a time limit or challenge the client to pick up a certain number of beads within a set time frame.
* Use a timer to add an element of competition or challenge.

**Reinforcement:**

* Verbal praise and encouragement.
* Small rewards (e.g., stickers, small toys).
* Use of visual supports (e.g., charts, graphs) to track progress.

**Skills Developed:**

* Fine motor dexterity
* Hand-eye coordination
* Hand strength
* Finger independence
* Visual-motor integration
