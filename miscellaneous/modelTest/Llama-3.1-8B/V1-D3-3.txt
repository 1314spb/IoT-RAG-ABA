- Procedure: 
  1. Begin a conversation with the individual using the conversation script.
  2. Encourage the individual to maintain their attention by making eye contact and using verbal cues (e.g., "Can you please look at me?").
  3. When the individual breaks attention, gently prompt them to refocus.
  4. After the conversation, ask the individual to summarize the main points discussed.
  5. Provide reinforcement for active listening (e.g., praise, a sticker, or a small reward).
  6. Gradually increase the duration of the conversation and the complexity of the topics discussed.
- Data Collection:
