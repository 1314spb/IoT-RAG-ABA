- Domain: Sensory Motor Skill
- Task: Balancing on a Balance Beam
- Subtask: 
  - Subtask 1: Improving balance and equilibrium
  - Subtask 2: Enhancing gross motor skills
- Description: This task is designed to improve balance and equilibrium in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or other developmental delays. Balancing on a balance beam involves standing on a narrow surface, which helps develop balance, equilibrium, and gross motor skills.
- Materials: 
  - A balance beam (e.g., a narrow board or a line on the floor)
  - Cones or markers to mark the beam
  - A soft surface for landing (e.g., a mat or a crash pad)
- Procedure:
  1. Begin with a wide beam or a line on the floor.
  2. Demonstrate how to stand on the beam and balance.
  3. Encourage the child to imitate the actions.
  4. Gradually narrow the beam or raise it off the ground.
  5. Rotate the beam or change its location to maintain interest.
- Data Collection: 
  - Observe the child's ability to balance on the beam.
  - Record the frequency and duration of successful balance.
  - Evaluate the child's ability to recover from balance loss.
- Variations:
  - Use different types of balance beams (e.g., a wobble board, a balance beam with a curve).
  - Incorporate obstacles or challenges on the beam (e.g., cones, blocks).
  - Modify the beam to accommodate different heights or abilities.
- Reinforcement: 
  - Praise the child for successful balance.
  - Offer verbal encouragement and positive reinforcement.
  - Use visual aids, such as stickers or stars, to track progress.
- Skills Developed: 
  - Balance and equilibrium
  - Gross motor skills
  - Postural awareness
  - Stability
