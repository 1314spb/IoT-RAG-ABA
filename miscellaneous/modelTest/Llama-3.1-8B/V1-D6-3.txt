**Task:** Teaching Calming Down after a Tantrum

**Sub task:** Encouraging a child to use a calming strategy after becoming upset

**Description:** This task aims to teach a child to recognize and regulate their emotions, reducing tantrums and promoting emotional well-being.

**Materials:**

* A calm-down jar or a visual aid to help the child identify and label their emotions
* A script or visual aid to prompt the child to use a calming strategy
* A variety of calming strategies, such as deep breathing, counting, or drawing

**Procedure:**

1. Begin by acknowledging the child's emotions and validating their feelings (e.g., "You're feeling really upset right now").
2. Use a script or visual aid to prompt the child to identify and label their emotions (e.g., "I see that you're feeling angry").
3. Encourage the child to choose a calming strategy from the list provided (e.g., "Let's take some deep breaths together").
4. Model the calming strategy and have the child imitate you (e.g., "Let's count to 10 together").
5. Gradually increase the duration of the calming strategy and encourage the child to use it independently.
