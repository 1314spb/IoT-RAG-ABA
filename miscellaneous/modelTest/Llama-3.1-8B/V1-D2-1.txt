### Task: "Sharing Emotions with a Friend"

#### Domain: Social Emotion

#### Task:
To teach an individual with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to effectively share and express their emotions with a friend in a social situation.

#### Sub task:
The individual will learn to:

1. Identify and label their emotions
2. Share their emotions with a trusted friend
3. Recognize and validate their friend's emotions

#### Description:
In this task, the individual will engage in a role-playing scenario with a trained therapist or peer, where they will practice sharing their emotions and receiving feedback on their expression and validation of their friend's emotions.

#### Materials:

* Two stuffed animals or dolls to represent the individual and their friend
* Emotion cards (e.g., happy, sad, angry, scared)
* A simple script for the role-playing scenario
* A whiteboard or paper for recording data

#### Procedure:

1. Initial Phase:
	* Introduce the concept of emotions and their labels (e.g., "How are you feeling today?")
	* Use the emotion cards to help the individual identify and label their emotions
2. Role-Playing:
	* Set up a simple scenario where the individual and their friend (stuffed animal) are playing together
	* The individual will express an emotion (e.g., "I'm feeling sad because I lost my favorite toy")
	* The friend will respond with a validating statement (e.g., "Aww, that's okay. I'm here for you")
	* The individual will then practice responding with a validating statement
3. Data Collection:
	* Record the individual's ability to identify and label their emotions
	* Record the individual's ability to share their emotions with their friend
	* Record the individual's ability to validate their friend's emotions

#### Variations:
