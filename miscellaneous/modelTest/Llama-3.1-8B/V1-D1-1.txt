- Domain: Academic and Learning
- Task: "Sorting and Labeling Objects by Category"
- Sub task: Sorting objects into categories (e.g., animals, toys, food) and labeling each object with its category.
- Description: This task aims to improve the individual's ability to categorize and label objects, which is an essential skill for learning and academic success.
- Materials: 
  - A set of objects that can be sorted into categories (e.g., pictures or real objects)
  - A whiteboard or a piece of paper with categories written on it
- Procedure:
  1. Begin by presenting the individual with a set of objects and asking them to sort them into categories.
  2. Once the individual has sorted the objects, ask them to label each object with its category.
  3. Provide feedback and guidance as needed to ensure the individual is accurately sorting and labeling the objects.
  4. Gradually increase the difficulty of the task by adding more objects or using more complex categories.
- Data Collection:
  - Observe the individual's ability to sort and label objects accurately.
  - Record the number of correct and incorrect sortings.
  - Take note of any challenges or difficulties the individual encounters.
- Variations:
  - Use different types of objects (e.g., toys, pictures, real objects).
  - Increase the number of categories or objects.
  - Use more complex categories (e.g., animals by habitat, food by course).
  - Have the individual sort and label objects in a specific order (e.g., from smallest to largest).
- Reinforcement:
  - Provide praise and encouragement for accurate sortings and labeling.
  - Use verbal or visual rewards (e.g., stickers, stars) for correct sortings and labeling.
  - Gradually phase out reinforcement as the individual becomes more accurate and independent.
- Skills Developed:
  - Categorization and classification
  - Labeling and vocabulary
  - Problem-solving and critical thinking
  - Fine motor skills (e.g., writing, drawing)
