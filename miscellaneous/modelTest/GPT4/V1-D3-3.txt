Domain: Communication
Task: Initiating Conversations
Sub task: Greeting Others Appropriately
Description: This task focuses on teaching the learner how to initiate conversations by greeting others appropriately. The learner will practice saying greetings like "Hello" or "Good morning" in different social settings.
Materials: Visual cue cards with greetings, role-playing partners, social scripts, and token board (optional).
Procedure:
Begin by explaining the importance of greeting others and when to use greetings.
Show the learner visual cues or social scripts for greetings (e.g., "Hi, my name is ___," "Good afternoon").
Role-play different scenarios where the learner can practice greetings (e.g., meeting a friend, entering a classroom).
Provide immediate feedback and praise for correct greetings, and use prompting if needed. Gradually fade the prompts as the learner gains confidence.
Data Collection: Track the number of times the learner initiates a greeting appropriately in each session, noting whether prompts were required. Record incorrect or missed opportunities to greet.
Variations:
Practice greetings in various contexts (e.g., greeting peers vs. greeting adults).
Vary the type of greeting based on the situation (e.g., formal vs. informal greetings).
Gradually increase the complexity by having the learner greet multiple people or add additional conversation starters.
Reinforcement: Offer praise, tokens, or a preferred activity as reinforcement for successfully initiating greetings or showing effort.
Skills Developed: Social communication, initiation of conversation, appropriate social interactions, confidence, and verbal skills.
