Variations: Gradually increase the duration of the activity. Alternate between different reading materials or writing tasks to maintain interest and generalize skills.
Reinforcement: Provide verbal praise, a sticker, or another small reward for maintaining focus for the set duration.
Skills Developed: Sustained attention, reading comprehension, writing skills, task persistence, self-regulation.
