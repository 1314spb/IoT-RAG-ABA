Domain: Behavioural Development
Task: Attention training: Sustaining attention - reading/writing
Sub task: Maintaining focus during reading or writing tasks for increasing durations
Description: The student will practice sustaining attention during reading or writing activities for a specified period. The goal is to gradually increase the duration that the student can focus on reading a passage or writing a short story without distractions.
Materials: Age-appropriate books, worksheets, pencils, timer, reinforcement chart
Procedure: Set a timer for an initial short duration (e.g., 3 minutes). Provide the student with a book or writing task and prompt them to focus on reading or writing until the timer goes off. Gradually increase the duration over multiple sessions. Use prompts and reinforcers as needed to maintain focus.
Data Collection: Record the duration of sustained attention, frequency of redirection required, and level of prompting used. Track any changes in focus duration over time.
Variations: Change the reading or writing materials to maintain interest and engagement. Use both fiction and non-fiction texts or creative writing prompts to diversify tasks.
Reinforcement: Provide verbal praise, tokens, or a preferred activity as reinforcement for maintaining focus for the set duration. Increase reinforcement as the duration increases.
Skills Developed: Sustained attention, task endurance, reading comprehension, writing skills, focus maintenance, and independence in academic activities.
