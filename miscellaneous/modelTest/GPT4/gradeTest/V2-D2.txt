Domain: Social Emotion
Task: Greetings: Responding
Sub task: Responding to "Hello" with an appropriate greeting
Description: The student will learn to respond appropriately when greeted by others with "Hello" or similar phrases. The task aims to develop social-emotional skills related to greetings and interpersonal communication.
Materials: Visual cue cards with different greeting phrases, social stories about greetings, role-playing scripts
Procedure: Present a scenario where a peer or adult says "Hello." Prompt the student to respond with an appropriate greeting (e.g., "Hello," "Hi," "Good morning"). Use visual prompts if needed and gradually fade them out as the student becomes more independent.
Data Collection: Record the frequency of independent greetings, the level of prompting required, and the accuracy of the responses.
Variations: Use different greetings such as "Good afternoon" or "How are you?" and practice responding in various settings (e.g., school, home, community).
Reinforcement: Provide praise or a small reward (e.g., high-five, sticker) each time the student responds appropriately. Reinforce any verbal attempt to respond, even if not perfectly accurate, to encourage participation.
Skills Developed: Social-emotional communication, greeting skills, interpersonal interactions, verbal responses, and generalization of social skills across different contexts.
