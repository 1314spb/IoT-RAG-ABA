Domain: Social Emotion
Task: Improving Emotional Regulation
Sub task: Identifying and Expressing Emotions
Description: This task focuses on teaching the child to recognize their emotions and appropriately express them in a social setting using simple communication techniques.
Materials: Emotion cards, mirror, emotion chart, social stories about emotions, and a small journal for drawing or writing about feelings.
Procedure:
Begin by showing emotion cards to the child and asking them to identify the emotion (e.g., happy, sad, angry).
Use a mirror to have the child practice mimicking the emotions shown on the cards.
Read a short social story related to different emotions and ask the child to point out how the characters feel.
Encourage the child to discuss times when they have felt those emotions and how they responded.
Teach the child simple phrases or words to express their feelings (e.g., "I feel sad").
Record their emotions in the journal by drawing or writing about how they felt during the day.
Data Collection: Record the frequency of correct identification and expression of emotions, as well as the child's ability to use the emotion words during sessions. Track the need for prompts and level of independence.
Variations:
Use a feelings chart in different situations (home, school) to identify emotions in real-time.
Use videos of people expressing emotions and ask the child to identify how they feel.
Pair the task with breathing exercises for calming when emotions are intense.
Reinforcement: Provide verbal praise ("Good job identifying your feelings!") and small rewards (e.g., stickers) when the child successfully identifies and expresses emotions.
