Domain: Social Emotion
Task: Identifying and Expressing Emotions
Sub task: Identifying Emotions in Pictures
Description: This task focuses on teaching the learner to recognize and name emotions based on facial expressions in pictures. The learner will be shown various pictures depicting different emotions and will identify the emotions shown.
Materials: Pictures of people displaying different emotions (happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.), emotion flashcards, a whiteboard or notebook for writing responses.
Procedure:
Present a picture showing a person expressing an emotion.
Ask the learner to identify the emotion in the picture (e.g., "How do you think this person feels?").
Use prompting as needed to help the learner correctly label the emotion. Gradually fade prompts.
Discuss why the person might feel that way, encouraging the learner to think about situations that cause those emotions.
Reinforce correct responses and effort.
Data Collection: Record the number of emotions correctly identified, the level of prompting required, and any incorrect responses.
Variations:
Use real-life scenarios or videos instead of pictures.
Transition from identifying emotions in others to discussing personal emotions in similar situations.
Vary the intensity of the emotions depicted in the pictures (mild happiness vs. intense joy).
Reinforcement: Provide praise, tokens, or access to preferred activities for correct identification of emotions and participation in discussions. Reinforce efforts even when incorrect.
Skills Developed: Emotion recognition, social awareness, verbal expression, empathy, and self-awareness.
