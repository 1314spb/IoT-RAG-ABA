Domain: Communication
Task: Improving Conversational Skills
Sub task: Turn-Taking in Conversations
Description: This task focuses on teaching the learner to take turns in a conversation. The learner will engage in a structured conversation with a peer or therapist, practicing when to speak and when to listen.
Materials: Conversation topic cards, visual turn-taking cues (e.g., a ball to pass back and forth), a timer (optional).
Procedure:
Begin with a simple conversation topic (e.g., "What is your favorite food?").
Use a visual cue (such as passing a ball) to signal whose turn it is to speak.
Prompt the learner to wait for their turn to speak and encourage active listening when it is the other personâ€™s turn.
Gradually reduce the use of visual cues as the learner becomes more comfortable with turn-taking.
Provide feedback and reinforcement after each successful turn-taking.
Data Collection: Record the number of successful turn-takings, whether the learner waited for their turn, and any prompts used.
Variations:
Vary the length of the conversation and complexity of topics.
Involve multiple peers to increase the challenge of managing turn-taking.
Introduce role-playing scenarios where turn-taking is critical, such as ordering at a restaurant.
Reinforcement: Provide praise, tokens, or preferred activities for successful participation in the conversation and appropriate turn-taking.
Skills Developed: Communication, social interaction, active listening, impulse control, and conversational skills.
