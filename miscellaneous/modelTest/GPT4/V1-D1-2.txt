Domain: Academic and Learning
Task: Teaching Alphabet Recognition
Sub task: Recognizing Uppercase and Lowercase Letters
Description: The child will learn to recognize and differentiate between uppercase and lowercase letters of the alphabet.
Materials: Flashcards with uppercase and lowercase letters, alphabet puzzles, writing board, markers.
Procedure:
Present the child with flashcards, showing one letter at a time.
Ask the child to identify whether the letter is uppercase or lowercase.
Provide prompts as needed (e.g., "Is this a big or small letter?").
Gradually reduce prompts as the child becomes more confident.
Use puzzles to reinforce letter matching (uppercase with lowercase).
Practice writing both uppercase and lowercase letters on a board.
Data Collection: Record the number of correct letter identifications without prompts, with prompts, and errors. Track over time to monitor progress.
Variations:
Use different fonts for the letters to generalize the skill.
Incorporate letter sounds (phonics) after letter identification.
Add time challenges to improve speed of recognition.
Reinforcement: Offer verbal praise and small tangible rewards (stickers, tokens) when the child correctly identifies letters or makes progress in recognizing them independently.
Skills Developed: Letter recognition, visual discrimination, fine motor skills (writing), attention to detail, and phonemic awareness.
