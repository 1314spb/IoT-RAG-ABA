Domain: Behavioral Development
Task: Improving Social Interaction Skills
Sub-task: Initiating and Responding to Peer Interactions
Description: The task focuses on helping the client improve their ability to initiate and respond appropriately during social interactions with peers. This will involve teaching the client to engage in greetings, small talk, and turn-taking activities.
Materials:
Social stories or scripts for role-playing.
Visual cue cards (e.g., “hello,” “your turn”).
Simple board games for turn-taking practice.
Peer partner or therapist for role-play.
Procedure:
Start with a brief role-play session using a social story that outlines a typical peer interaction (e.g., greeting and responding).
Practice the interaction with the therapist, using visual cue cards to prompt the client if necessary.
Progress to turn-taking games, allowing the client to practice initiating and responding to game-related interactions.
Gradually fade visual prompts and increase the complexity of the interaction, such as introducing new peers or group games.
Provide immediate reinforcement for appropriate social behaviors.
Data Collection:
Track the number of successful peer interactions initiated and responded to.
Measure latency (time taken to initiate or respond) and accuracy (correctness of interaction).
Variations:
Introduce different social scenarios (e.g., asking to join a game, offering help).
Practice in various settings, such as the playground or classroom.
Vary the peers involved in the interaction to promote generalization.
Reinforcement: Use verbal praise, tokens, or a preferred item/activity when the client successfully initiates or responds in a social interaction. Ensure reinforcement is provided immediately after the desired behavior.
Skills Developed:
Improved social communication and interaction.
Enhanced turn-taking and cooperation with peers.
Increased self-confidence in social situations.
