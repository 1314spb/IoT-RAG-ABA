Domain: Communication
Task: Increasing Functional Communication Skills
Sub task: Verbal Requesting using Functional Communication Training (FCT)
Description: This task focuses on helping a non-verbal or minimally verbal client learn to make verbal requests using functional communication. The client will learn to use vocalizations or approximations of words to express needs or wants, such as requesting a preferred item.
Materials:
Picture cards of commonly used items (e.g., food, toys, drink)
Communication board
Reinforcers (e.g., preferred snacks, toys)
Visual or auditory prompts
Procedure:
Present the client with a situation where they need to request an item (e.g., placing a preferred snack out of reach).
Prompt the client to vocalize or use a word approximation (e.g., "more," "want") to request the item.
If the client does not respond, provide a verbal or visual prompt.
Reinforce immediately by giving the item once the client attempts or makes a vocal request.
Gradually fade prompts as the client gains confidence in using vocal requests.
Data Collection:
Track the frequency of independent vocal requests.
Record the level of prompt required (e.g., full prompt, partial prompt, independent).
Variations:
Use different settings (e.g., home, therapy, school) to encourage generalization of communication skills.
Increase the complexity of requests (e.g., from single words to phrases like “I want ____”).
Reinforcement: Use highly preferred items or activities as positive reinforcement to motivate communication. Gradually move to natural reinforcement where the client's requests naturally result in desired outcomes (e.g., asking for a snack leads to receiving the snack).
Skills Developed:
Verbal communication
Requesting needs/wants
Increased independence in communication
Social interaction skills through communication
