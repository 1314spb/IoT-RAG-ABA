Description: This task focuses on teaching the child to recognize and identify letters of the alphabet through interactive and engaging activities.
Materials: Flashcards with letters, alphabet books, digital alphabet learning apps, a whiteboard, and markers.
Procedure:
Begin by showing the child a letter using a flashcard or on the whiteboard.

Data Collection: Track the childâ€™s response time and accuracy in identifying and tracing each letter. Record the frequency of correct responses and prompt use.
Variations:
Use magnetic letters or letter puzzles for hands-on interaction.
Incorporate songs or videos that emphasize the alphabet.
Practice identifying letters in books or signs during reading sessions.
Reinforcement: Provide verbal praise ("Great job!") or tokens/stickers for correct identification and tracing.
Skills Developed:
Letter recognition
Fine motor skills through tracing
Early reading skills
Increased attention to task completion
